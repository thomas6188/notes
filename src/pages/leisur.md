Hi there. This blog post summarizes what I do in my leisure time. Nothing fancy, just the regular things.  

<br>

##### <ins>_Science and Tech_</ins>

I have always been fascinated by Science and Technology. My love for tech started (during my high school days) when I read a magazine called The Chip. While growing up, I didn't have access to Internet, so this magazine was my gateway to the world of gadgets, apps, and technology in general. The first personal computer I had was a Pentium 3 Desktop, with 48 MB RAM. This was my lab for trying out a new OS, apps, and games. I still remember making a scene ðŸ˜­ at home so that my parents can buy me a 16 MB RAM module because Win XP won't install with anything less ðŸ˜ž.   

Today, 15 years later, nothing has changed for me. I still read that magazine (now Digit), I still get excited when I see a new product launch, a new breakthrough or a discovery in science and tech.  Checkout the Tesla auto-pilot feature- the way it works (flawlessly) is simply amazing and mind blowing.

##### <ins>_Food and Travel_</ins>

One thing I believe when it comes to Food and Travel is that it should never be a forced activity. It is best enjoyed alone or with people you like. Instagram or Facebook posts shouldn't be the deciding factor, your fondness for the people, place, and food should.

##### Sports

Cricket (W&P), Tennis (W), and WWE(W).  

<br>


If there is one guilty pleasure that I have when it comes to sports, that would be WWE (if you count it as Sports). Back in the days, it was known as WWF.  I still remember the good old days, when I used to play VCR cassettes on repeat mode, every time I travelled to my hometown in Kerala for my summer vacation.  
The matches (and storylines) we have now cannot hold a candle to what we had during the Attitude Era. With the passage of time, and as I grew older, the thrill for the sports fizzled out. Although, I do enjoy major annual events such as WrestleMania, in a hope that I get to see some of the old WWE Hall Of Famers.  Stone Cold's entrance music still gives me goose bumps ðŸ¤©.
