<ins>_About my work_</ins> 

I have 9+ years of experience in SharePoint and Office 365 space, with focus on cloud and related technologies- SharePoint Online, Office 365, Azure, SharePoint Server, Dot Net, and JavaScript.

I currently work as a Tech Lead at Infosys. I am part of Workplace Transformation team that helps customers build a Modern Workplace using Microsoft SAAS and Cloud offerings. 

I started my career as a SharePoint developer in 2010. Back in those days, everything was on-prem, and WSP Builder was the goto extensionðŸ˜‘. Building a custom component required a SharePoint Server, not only for deployment but also for developement. I still have the VDI files of SP 2007, 2010, and 2013 dev servers in my backup driveðŸ˜ƒ.

SharePoint has evolved a lot since then. It now uses modern toolchain for almost all dev work, and the product itself is now offered as part of Office 365 SAAS. Microsoft still offers SharePoint as on-premise application (latest being SP 2019).
