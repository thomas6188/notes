##### <ins>_About my work_</ins>

I am a Tech Lead at Infosys. I have 9+ years of experience in SharePoint and Office 365 space, with focus on cloud and related technologies- SharePoint Online, Office 365, Azure, SharePoint Server, Dot Net, and JavaScript.

At Infosys, I am part of Microsoft Workplace Transformation team that helps customers build a Modern Workplace using Microsoft SAAS and Cloud offerings.

I started my career as a SharePoint developer in 2011. Back in those days, everything was on-prem, and WSP Builder was the goto extensionðŸ˜‘. Building a custom component required a SharePoint Server, not only for deployment but also for developement. I still have the VDI files of SP 2007, 2010, and 2013 dev servers in my backup driveðŸ˜ƒ.
